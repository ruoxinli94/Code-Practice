## 5 steps of decision making 
#### Step1: Define questions. 
The question needs to be measurable, clear and concise. Starting form the faced problem and define the metrics.  
The question should either qualify or disqualify the solution to the problem. 
#### Step2: Set measurement.
* What to measure: the related data that is needed to answer the defined question.
* How to measure: the key factors, time scale, unit of measure. Should be cristal clear to avoid misinterpretation of the data. 
#### Step3: Collect Data.
One principle is cost efficiency. Consider the existing datasets before collect new data.  
Determine a file storing and naming system before collecting the data to avoid replicate work from different team members.  
If the collected data is qualitative, define the interview or the observation template first such as the travel diary.  
Add the metadata of the collected datasets such as the date, source notes to keep track. 
#### Step4: Analyze data 
Start with the basic statistic of the data. Analyze the tends, correlations, variations and outliers. This is process, may need to repeat step 1 to 3 to adjust the dataset to match the inital questions. 
#### Step5: Interpret results
Warning: cannot ever prove a hypothesis is true, can only fail to reject the hypithesis.  
Key questions when interpreting:
* How does the result anser the initial questions?
* How does the data defend against other objections?
* The limitation fo the conclusion.
